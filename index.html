<p style="color:white; text-shadow:2px 2px 2px #000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; I grew up nextdoor to a ham radio operator with a very large antenna in his yard (rest in peace <a href="https://www.qrz.com/lookup?callsign=KG7QT" style="color:#00FF00">KG7QT</a>).&nbsp; I spent a good deal of time over there talking about ham radio with him - probably more time than I spent playing with his kids. He planted the seed and it&#39;s only been until recently that I decided to look into getting into the hobby.</p>

<p style="color:white; text-shadow:2px 2px 2px #000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; I passed both the&nbsp;Tech and General exams on TWOsday (2/22/2022) and received my call sign the following day (a huge thanks&nbsp;to the <a href="https://aarg.club" style="color:#00FF00">Aurora ARG</a>).&nbsp;I currently have a Baofang UV-5R HT and I&#39;m saving up for something HF - I am thinking I&#39;ll probably start with the Xeigu G90, but if you have any suggestions on a cheapish starter, let me know.</p>

<p style="color:white; text-shadow:2px 2px 2px #000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; I am 45 years old, married to a beautiful wife and have two beautiful&nbsp;children. We live on a 3/4 acre lot in a small town in Utah,&nbsp;USA. I have a few hobbies I tend to rotate between, including:</p>
